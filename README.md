# SpaceGame - aka Mercenary

My final project at Iron Yard. This is a 2-d side scrolling game utilizing the SpriteKit framework. 

Features include weapon upgrades, score tracking, enemy spawn/attacks, player movement and attack, parallax scrolling backgrounds.

It features an original sountrack composed in FL Studio and graphics created in Sketch 3. The SFX are placeholders taken from a great game called "Jets n' Guns" which was used as research for this project.
